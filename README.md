<h1 align="left">Hi üëã, I'm Kadeem</h1>
<h3 align="left">I'm a creative engineerüí° turning fun ideas into AI products ü§ñ I'm passionate about building in public and teaching/inspiring others to build, promote, and monetize their ideas üöÄ</h3>

<p>
  I've built software professionally for almost 10 years, launching products that serve hundreds of thousands of users in sectors such as banking and renewable energy. I'm brimming with ideas of things I'd like to exist in the world and am on a mission to bring as many of them to life as possible.
</p>
<p>
  Ever since I got into computer science, I've been hooked on AI. I think AI is going to push software to the next level, and I'm all about leveraging AI in as many places as possible to build smarter, more intuitive, and amazing software.
</p>

<p>
  I look forward to a world where everyone has easy access to the tools and knowledge they need to build creative products that enhance their lives and turn those products into profitable companies. (p.s. I'm a big believer in building solo and I'm excited to see the age of billion-dollar one-person companies)

‚ö° Fun fact: I wanted to be a neuroscientist for most of my life until I found computer science. Now, with AI, I've found a sweet spot üò¨
